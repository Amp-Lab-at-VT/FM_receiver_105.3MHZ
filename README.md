## Educational Value Added

PCB design education value is custom RF pcb design and research of relevant components

## Tasks


## Design Decisions
General Design Layout: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1e5mTtKONOJFI6KM5OiUcPPun2-vZfV_UhMkgm8joVLU/edit?pli=1
- The General design is an analog radio with a digital display
- The radio receiver circuit will be designed for signals between 90 MHz and 107 MHz
- The user will be able to tune the channel via variable capacitor
- A switch will configure the audio input circuit to radio input / regular audio input (cable)
- User will be able to adjust the volume and equalize the audio using potentiometers
- The audio circuit will drive a low resistance speaker 
- Spectrogram, and more information  will be visible via SPI display
